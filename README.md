This was a project create in Unreal Engine 4 for my Game Programming 2 class. With this project, I learned to use the Unreal engine, including both Blueprints and C++. The final project is a bit eclectic because I was learning along the way, but UE4 is a great tool and I learned a lot from working with it.

The game is a first-person platformer/puzzler, with three levels that the player can go through in any order. Players try to complete each level as quickly as possible, which involves a combination of dodging various enemies and traps, as well as opening doors using special 'keys' and smashing through rock formations with a hammer. I think the most challenging aspect of this project was keeping the game as a coherent experience as I learned each part of the engine along the way, and avoiding feature creep as I began to open up the possibilities of the engine.
